THINGS TO FIX:
-looks like there might be a character limit per entry to js alert(notes). I think I can still launch with notes like this, but will need a better system in the first update

-textarea input in /journal, enter doesn't submmit and empty spaces are erased after submitting

POSSIBLE version x.x FEATURES:
-add way for users to download their tables
-timer?
-have results load up to 10 weeks and then have a link to show more
-add way to view a chart that shows a user's progress
-some kind of custom styling if a day's pomo count is higher than the necessary average
-maybe make a version history link on load page...maybe only if i make significant changes after launching
-a way to search table parameters and display charts, eg. days over x amount of tomatoes, rank days from least to most
